# HW3: Search and Pathfinding
=================================

## Description:
This program performs 3 different algorithms which are, breadth-first search, iterative deepening search and a* search on a search space that is given in a txt file.

## Instructions:
In order to run the executable file, use the following command:

`java â€“jar hw3.jar <txt file> <algorithm>`

where txt file is the name of file being used to obtain the search space.

For the algorithm argument, you can use the following options:
  
`
"BFS" - (Breadth-first search)
"IDS" - (Iterative deepening search)
"AS" - (A* search)
`

## Notes:
* Txt file has to be in the same location as the hw3.jar
* When typing the name of the file, also include the extension .txt
